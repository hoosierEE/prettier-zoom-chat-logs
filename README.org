For reasons I do not understand, Zoom has at least two different chat text file formats.

One format shows up in my Downloads folder on my local machine, the other is available from the Zoom website in the recordings tab.
This project works on the latter format.

So first download your chat text files from the Zoom website's Recordings tab, then

#+begin_src
for f in *.txt; do python3 pretty.py $f > $f.html; done
#+end_src

And enjoy.
